        description: Yes, but you’re crazy if you start one. The industry maxim for innovation says that for every ten ventures, two will fail outright, six will stagger along as walking wounded and two will hit home runs – hello Airbnb and Uber. If 80 percent of startups all but fail, why start one? You’re either remarkably brave or undeniably foolish. Regulation, low margins, consolidation, fragmentation, legacy technology and fickle consumers leave behind an unattractive and almost impenetrable market for entrepreneurs and their venture funding. But according to Phocuswright and CB Insight’s latest data, a few bright spots remain for the tenacious and courageous. Join the session to find out what they are.
